# Plugin

## What is a plugin?

A plugin is a Javascript object which acts as the central state object for a single molstar canvas. In general, you interact with the molstar by creating and initialising a plugin, and then using its attributes and methods to change what appears on screen. Each canvas has one plugin object attached to it, acting as the interface between the developer and what appears on the canvas.

It is so called because it 'plugs in' to an existing interface or application, rather than being a self-contained UI by itself.
