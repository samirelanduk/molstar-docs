# Canvas

## The Canvas Element

A canvas is a HTML element, `<canvas>`, embedded in the HTML like any other element. What's special about the canvas, is that you can draw on it with Javascript.

Most elements have their appearance determined solely by CSS. Their interior might be a single colour, or perhaps a gradient of some kind. It might have a border with some sort of pattern. But ultimately, unless it's an image, it's really all just decoration and positioning for text. With a canvas however, you can draw shapes, arcs, lines - anything you like. They are essentially programatically created images that can change based on user interactions.

For this reason, canvases often underpin many of the complex, dynamic, interactive interfaces we see on the web. Zoomable maps, games, document rendering - and of course, manipulatable 3D scenes such as molstar - all make use of the canvas to do this.
